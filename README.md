# Data Structures Course Documentation

## Introduction

This repository is established to document and share my individual learning journey from the Data Structures course at my university. It emphasizes consolidating and disseminating knowledge on data structures, including concepts, design, and their application in efficiently managing and structuring data for effective big data processing and AI utilization, all without directly citing or employing the instructor's proprietary materials.

## Purpose

The main objective of this repository is to organize my learnings, reflect on the taught subjects, and deepen my comprehension of data structures
